### Query Twitter Data
I used [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) to query Twitter's API for additional data beyond the data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive.
- First, if you do not already have one, you need to sign up for a [Twitter account](https://help.twitter.com/en/create-twitter-account).
- Next, to set up a developer account, follow the directions on [Twitter’s Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/developer-portal/overview), in the “How to Apply” section.
