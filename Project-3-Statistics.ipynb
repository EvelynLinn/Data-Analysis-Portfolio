Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.\n",

This will assure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the criteria.  As a final check, assure you meet all the criteria on the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).\n",

All four variables have low p-values (0, 0.191, 0.074 and 0.13 for intercept, ab_page, UK and US respectively), which suggests they are statistically related to predicting the conversion, but since the Type I error rate should be less than 0.05, the p-values here should be less than 0.1, this means that the model should probably exclude ab_page and US. \n",

    "<font color='red'>revised:</font>In summary, we failed to reject the null hypothesis. Based on the current data, old page performs better in converting users. However, considering all models are non-conclusive, and the data was collected in a short duration of time, it's advisable that the website run the test longer in order to collect more data, which can hofully help us finding a better model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P-values\n",
    "1. In the sampling distribution model, the p-value at 0.9 suggests that the type I error rate of the model can be as high as 0.1, exceeding that of alpha, thus this model is not ideal. \n",
    "2. In the first logistic regression model, ab_page's p-value at 0.19 is too high for desired alpha 0.10, thus it's also not ideal for prediction. \n",
    "3. In the second logistic regression models, all variables' p-values are higher then the type I error limit, so it's not ideal either. \n",

    "Once you are satisfied with the status of your Notebook, you should save it in a format that will make it easy for others to read. You can use the __File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)__ menu to save your notebook as an .html file. If you are working locally and get an error about \"No module name\", then open a terminal and try installing the missing module using `pip install <module_name>` (don't include the \"<\" or \">\" or any words following a period in the module name).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will submit both your original Notebook and an HTML or PDF copy of the Notebook for review. There is no need for you to include any data files with your submission. If you made reference to other websites, books, and other resources to help you in solving tasks in the project, make sure that you document them. It is recommended that you either add a \"Resources\" section in a Markdown cell at the end of the Notebook report, or you can include a `readme.txt` file documenting your sources.\n",

    "### Submit the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're ready, click on the \"Submit Project\" button to go to the project submission page. You can submit your files as a .zip archive or you can link to a GitHub repository containing your project files. If you go with GitHub, note that your submission will be a snapshot of the linked repository at time of submission. It is recommended that you keep each project in a separate repository to avoid any potential confusion: if a reviewer gets multiple folders representing multiple projects, there might be confusion regarding what project is to be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can take us up to a week to grade the project, but in most cases it is much faster. You will get an email once your submission has been reviewed. If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at dataanalyst-project@udacity.com. In the meantime, you should feel free to continue on with your learning journey by beginning the next module in the program."
